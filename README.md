RTMP or Real Time Midi Program is designed to accompany free form musical performance based on input from the user (as of 0.4) outputting MIDI.

Installation and Setup:

RTMP uses the Python Library SCAMP. Type the following command in the command prompt:

pip install scamp

0.4 utilizes external instrumental plugins using LoopMIDI (Windows)

The user can configure the code by utilizing the comments in rtmp0.4.py to use the included default midi sounds if not using LoopMIDI and external plugins.
