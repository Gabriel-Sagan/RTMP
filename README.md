RTMP or Real Time Midi Program is designed to accompany free form musical performance outputting MIDI based on user input (as of 0.4).

## Installation and Setup:

RTMP uses the Python library SCAMP to generate real time musical output. Type the following command in the command prompt:

pip install scamp

0.4 utilizes external instrumental plugins using LoopMIDI (Windows)

The user can configure the code by utilizing the comments in rtmp0.4.py to use the included default midi sounds if not using LoopMIDI and external plugins.

## Run the app:

Configure instrument sound, run rtmp0.4.py, and input requested information.

When prompted to input trichord Forte numbers, refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_set_classes

Use i for inversions instead of B (e.g. 3-2A and 3-2B become 3-2 and 3-2i).
